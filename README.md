# EYLI Computing

Everything You Learn In (EYLI) Computing is a work-in-progress condensed guide to the MOE secondary school Computing syllabus.

## Foreword

Hi, I'm Haziq Hairil, a student at the School of Science and Technology, Singapore (Computing+ class of 2023). I started this project because I don’t believe that you need to spend two whole years learning everything O-Level Computing tests you for. In fact, I aim for a non-Computing student to be able to get through the entire completed guide in under a month. Also, seeing as SST offers Computing+, I’m hoping that this guide will help you get through MOE’s more basic computing syllabus so that Computing+ classes can spend more time on the +, thereby enriching the Computing+ experience in SST.

## Who this guide is for

This guide is targeted at existing Computing+ students as a form of revision, as well as lower secondary students to spark their interest in joining Computing+ in SST.
