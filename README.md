# EYLI Computing

Everything You Learn In (EYLI) Computing is a work-in-progress condensed guide to the MOE secondary school Computing syllabus.

This guide is targeted at existing SST Computing+ students as a form of revision, as well as lower secondary students to spark their interest in joining Computing+ in SST. Since this is a condensed guide, I aim for a non-Computing student to be able to get through the entire completed guide in under a month.
