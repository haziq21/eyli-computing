    Hi, I’m <a href="https://github.com/haziq21" class="text-cyan-400 hover:underline">Haziq Hairil</a>,
    the author and designer of <span class="font-medium">Everything You Learn In Computing</span>.
    I’m also a student at the School of Science and Technology, Singapore (Computing+ class of 2023).
    I wrote this guide because I don’t believe that you need two years to learn everything O-Level
    Computing tests you for - my aim is for you to be able to get through this entire guide in under a
    month. Also, seeing as SST offers Computing+, I’m hoping that this guide will help you get through
    MOE’s more basic computing syllabus so that Computing+ classes can spend more time on the +, thereby
    enriching the Computing+ experience in SST.
</p>
<p>
    This guide is targeted at existing Computing+ students as a form of revision, as well as
    lower secondary students to spark their interest in joining Computing+ in SST.
