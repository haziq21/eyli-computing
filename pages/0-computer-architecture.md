## Units of data

Data is information. The smallest unit of data in a modern computer is a bit (binary digit) - a 1 or a 0. However, the smallest unit of data that computers can address is a byte (8 bits).

| Symbol | Unit     | Size in bytes    |
| ------ | -------- | ---------------- |
| kB     | kilobyte | 1000<sup>1</sup> |
| kiB    | kibibyte | 1024<sup>1</sup> |
| MB     | megabyte | 1000<sup>2</sup> |
| MiB    | mebibyte | 1024<sup>2</sup> |
| GB     | gigabyte | 1000<sup>3</sup> |
| GiB    | gibibyte | 1024<sup>3</sup> |
| TB     | terabyte | 1000<sup>4</sup> |
| TiB    | tebibyte | 1024<sup>4</sup> |

> In the past, units like kilobyte and megabyte were based on powers of 1024, but since 1998, it was agreed that SI prefixes should follow their standard meanings, while new binary prefixes (kibi, mebi, gibi, etc.) would be used to represent powers of 1,024.

## Memory

Data is stored as many tiny electronic switches arranged in a grid. Each switch can be either on or off (1 or 0). When we use the word “memory”, we’re usually referring to RAM and not the other kinds of memory. “Storage” is usually used to refer to secondary storage.
